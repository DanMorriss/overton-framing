          I always believed that as an artist, I knew the best way to display my
          work. That was until I was introduced to Overton Framing in
          Marlborough. Amanda and Kate are both artists and understand that a
          frame can either make or break an artwork. They are both highly
          skilled but above all, they bring a sensitivity to their craft that
          gives them the edge over their competitors. I no longer drop off work
          with instructions as to how it should be framed. I leave to them and
          have never been disappointed. When my work leaves their studio, it is
          transformed into a piece of furniture that would grace any interior.

          I can highly recommend Amanda when you are looking for a good framer
          for your pictures. I am an artist and, as such, the quality of framing
          is very important to me. I have had work framed by Amanda for a few
          years now. Her work is excellent in terms of the accuracy of
          construction and she has a very good eye. She is very accommodating,
          and I find her help when choosing styles of mounting and framing
          invaluable. Her prices are very competitive too.
